## Inspiration

The inspiration for Virtual Dressing Room came as I online shopping but they don't have the feature of try-on different clothing items together with accessories. With the increase in online shopping, I wanted to develop a virtual dressing website that allowed shoppers to easily try-on different items in the store in a easy-to-use format that allows shopping to be fun and creative.
